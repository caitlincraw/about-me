        <h1>Getting to Know Caitlin Crawford</h1>
        <img src="images/banff.jpg" alt="Me in front of Lake Louise in Banff National Park!">
    <p>I currently live in Chattanooga, TN with my husband, Grant, 
        and our three cats, Toots, Milo, and Driz. 
        I work as a Planning Analyst for the local 
        regional planning agency, but after the DigitalCrafts 
        Bootcamp, I hope to use software and coding to solve urban transportation
        problems!! In my free time, I love to rock climb, mountain bike, 
        paddleboard, garden, trail run, etc... literally anything outside. 
        I have gone into a fully remote position due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I 
        honestly don't think I can go back to a traditional office job. 
        I have gotten too used to having a cat on my lap all day, everyday, lol!</p>
    <p>Now here is a list of my 3 favorite animals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP4NMoJcFd4">Cats, of course!!!</a></li>
        <li>Llamas</li>
        <li>Penguins</li>
    </ul>
