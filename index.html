        <h1>Getting to Know Caitlin Crawford</h1>
        <img src="images/banff.jpg" alt="A picture of myself in front of Lake Louise in Banff National Park!">
    <p>I currently live in Chattanooga, TN with my husband, Grant, and our three cats, Toots, Milo, and Driz. I work as a Planning Analyst for the local regional planning agency, but after the DigitalCrafts Bootcamp, I hope to break into the software development world and solve big scale urban issues!! In my free time, I love to rock climb, mountain bike, paddleboard, garden, trail run, etc... literally anything outside. I have gone into a fully remote position due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I honestly don't think I could go back to a traditional office job. I don't think I could give up working with a cat constantly on my lap, lol!</p>
    <p>Now here is a list of my top 3 favorite animals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP4NMoJcFd4">Cats, of course!!!</a></li>
        <li>Llamas</li>
        <li>Penguins</li>
    </ul>
